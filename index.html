          <p>The City College of New York is moving its Office of Student Success into a new space on the campus of its school for civic and global leadership, Colin Powell.</p>

          <p>The office is dedicated to working with students to help them navigate higher education. The office is also working to further establish its resources for first-generation students, who are the first in their families to go to college.</p>

          <p>The office offers workshops and mentoring to help students with college preparation, such as applications and financial aid. The office also aims to aid students with their transition from school to a career, helping students establish connections and explore opportunities. </p>

          <p>Cynthia Gutierrez is the manager of mentoring and alumni relations at Colin Powell’s first-generation student resource office. Gutierrez is a first-generation student herself and through her own experiences, she is dedicated to supporting students who are navigating education similarly. </p>

          <p>“I'm helping students who look like me and who have felt marginalized and maybe felt like college wasn't for them because I know that that's something that was true for me,” Gutierrez said.</p>

          <p>The City College of New York is home to a diverse campus of undergraduate students with more than 87% of the students identifying as people of color.</p>

          <p>“I think CCNY’s diversity is unique. I think it's the most reflective of New York City in terms of it being a melting pot,” Gutierrez said.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the school for civic and global leadership is made up of about 70% of first-generation students. </p>

        <p>Despite the office’s focus on providing support to first-generation students, Gutierrez said that the services are accessible to any student. </p>

        <p>“It’s not exclusive, in terms of our programming to first-gen students, because the understanding is that even if you're not technically first-gen, like even if your parents went to college, chances are that you're still going to struggle in a similar way,” Gutierrez said. </p>
